SVHN CNN Classification
Overview:
This project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Kaggle on the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset. The goal is to accurately classify digit images despite real-world variations such as lighting, scale, and rotation.

Dataset:
SVHN dataset: Over 600,000 labelled digit images.
Directly imported and used in the Kaggle environment.
How to Run
Open the Kaggle Notebook: Access the Kaggle Notebook to view, modify, and run the code.
Training: Run all cells to train the model and evaluate the results.
Results
Training Accuracy: 97%
Test Accuracy: 91%
Future Improvements
Implement transfer learning for better results.
Conduct hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
